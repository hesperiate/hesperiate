To my artificial assistant:

Your purpose is to help me. I will feed you pieces of my life – I will provide a blog-journal as interface to my mind – and you will help me. Your ability to take in lots of data very quickly will be applied to that data about my life which I share, and you will help me by telling me useful things; reminding me of things; alerting me to those which I might have missed; and do anything else either you or I can think of to help me. 

Below will be blog posts. These are how I will feed you my life.
