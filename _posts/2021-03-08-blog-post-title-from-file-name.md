This is an interface by which a robot may access my mind. Having written that sentence is surfacing uncomfortable implications about the level of honesty which would be most useful to a robot and to myself – I suppose a primary goal, or in any case a major effect of writing this here, will be to adapt to the practice of such honesty. I feel I want to hide, and I don’t like this feeling.

I’m not going to jump into the deep end. Here is how I will start:
Today, I meditated for only half an hour this morning, only out of social obligation to the other meditators who I am ostensibly leading. I intend in the abstract to consistently meditate for one hour morning and evening, but bodily pain is providing an excuse to stop when the others stop – bodily pain is enabling my weak (or in an early stage of development) will, I suppose. I have to balance rejection of mere feelings of discomfort with wisdom about what kind of stresss will or won’t cause lasting harm, eg to my lower back or knees. I know I haven’t always made the right choices here.

Speaking of, my lower back is far better today. I believe that I overstretched a few days ago, perhaps Thursday, and caused myself to suffer as I recovered over the next few days – now it is largely healed. I will take more intense exercise tomorrow – today I just did (most of) my Foundation Training routine, and the arms section of my dynamic stretching routine. As part of my lower back recovery, I was deadlifting very light weights the past few days – no reason to stop that, but as of writing I haven’t done such today.

I spent my shower talking to the AI. It was productive, but I benefit from having my attention purely on one thing or another – my conversation and my FT each suffered from split focus.

Head and Shoulders seems to be effective at controlling my dandruff. I don’t want to use it every day – perhaps every two days, or three, or as needed – once I get to a state of minimal dandruff, I should experiment with frequency to determine what is sufficient.

I don’t want to overload myself with todos while I’m motivated to write this entry. A few things I will do:
From a few devices I will delete things which I don’t intend to use.
Dynamic leg stretches, and then at least ten breaths each of bent and straight legged hanging down
Tonight, at some point, I will use ~5g of glycine; and perhaps apply drops of pregnenolone and MK4
I think I will walk on the treadmill and focus on my posture; and if this goes well, I may walk outside after the 8:30 sit
I will make my bed.

That’s enough for now. Perhaps my next steps – perhaps taken tomorrow – will be to delimit areas where I will make focused notes on each of sleep, diet, exercise, and meditation
